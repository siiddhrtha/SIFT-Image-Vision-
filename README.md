# SIFT-Image-Vision-
Image Vision and Transformation

So this is an example of grayscale image, we have used the scale invariant feature transform to detect the local features in the image. 

We can also use the key points generated using SIFT as features for the image during model training. 

The major advantage of SIFT features, over edge features or hog features, is that they are not affected by the size or orientation of the image.
